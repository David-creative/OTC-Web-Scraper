# Git Cheat Sheet Commands

1. git pull - updates changes made by prior contributors (always do first before starting to add code!!)

* Working on code, doing changes.

2. git add . - add all the changes that I've made to current directory to version control which is Git(. means all the changes)

3. git commit -m "message here" - confirming/saving changes made by me

4. git push - pushing/uploading all changes to github (to remote so Leo can changes I've made)

* Git is like Android, Github is like Samsung, Oneplus, etc
* Git only lives on my computer, Github allows for remote collaboration
